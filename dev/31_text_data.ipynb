       "      <td>xxbos xxmaj this film sat on my xxmaj xxunk for weeks before i watched it . i xxunk a self - indulgent xxunk flick about relationships gone bad . i was wrong ; this was an xxunk xxunk into the screwed - up xxunk of xxmaj new xxmaj xxunk . \\n\\n xxmaj the format is the same as xxmaj max xxmaj xxunk ' \" la xxmaj xxunk , \" based on a play by xxmaj arthur xxmaj xxunk , who is given an \" inspired by \" credit . xxmaj it starts from one person , a prostitute , standing on a street corner in xxmaj brooklyn . xxmaj she is picked up by a home contractor , who has sex with her on the hood of a car , but ca n't come . xxmaj he refuses to pay her . xxmaj when he 's off xxunk , she answers his cell phone and takes a message . xxmaj she runs away with his keys . \\n\\n xxmaj then the story switches to the contractor , who pays a professional call on a rich , bored xxmaj new xxmaj york woman , who plays with him until he is xxunk , then she pulls away . xxmaj she tells him how desperate and unhappy she is ; he tells her how beautiful she is , and lucky . xxmaj as he is leaving , she asks if he would have sex with her . xxmaj she sits on top of him , xxunk up and down . xxmaj this time he comes , the he leaves . \\n\\n xxmaj the woman and her husband throw a dinner party for their xxunk friends . xxmaj xxunk ( robert ) is talking business , wife ( ellen ) is bored , and switches the subject to sex , and how often men and women think about it . xxmaj husband switches conversation to desert . xxmaj later , after the xxunk leave , xxmaj ellen tries to entice xxmaj robert into sex . xxmaj robert wants none of it , and puts on a jazz record . xxmaj ellen turns on the radio ; xxmaj robert turns up the music ; xxmaj ellen turns on the xxup tv ; xxmaj robert turns on another xxup tv . xxmaj xxunk ensues . xxmaj ellen goes up on the roof , xxmaj robert joins her . xxmaj ellen confesses that she needs to experience more men , men other than xxmaj robert . xxmaj robert says that he too needs to experience men . \\n\\n xxmaj we next follow xxmaj robert as he visits an artist , xxmaj martin , played by xxmaj steve xxmaj buscemi . i wish xxmaj buscemi could have more roles like this , where he is a sexy , smart , totally xxunk guy . xxmaj robert xxunk xxmaj martin 's work , much more than it deserves , xxunk to get it into a show . xxmaj martin is excited , until it turns out that xxmaj robert is speaking out of his xxunk , it is all a xxunk dance . xxmaj robert tries to kiss xxmaj martin , on the lips , and xxmaj martin pulls back , saying that he is not gay . xxmaj robert xxunk that he 's not gay either , xxmaj martin xxunk . xxmaj both admit that the xxunk are bad . xxmaj robert is about to leave , when xxmaj martin allows xxmaj robert to kiss him . xxmaj they make out , and xxmaj robert goes down on xxmaj martin . \\n\\n xxmaj next we follow xxmaj martin , as he xxunk for an art show at a xxmaj manhattan gallery . xxmaj he is xxunk by the xxunk , xxmaj anna , played by xxmaj rosario xxmaj dawson . ( i had to cut some of this review to keep it under 1 xxrep 3 0 words ) … and they make love to each other . \\n\\n xxmaj we next follow xxmaj anna , who is sitting at a lunch stand . xxmaj her boyfriend , xxmaj nick ( adrian xxmaj xxunk ) , enters , bearing xxunk . xxmaj she is cold toward him ; he tries to figure out why . xxmaj he coaxes out of her the information that she has had sex with someone while he was in xxmaj san xxmaj francisco . xxmaj she coaxes out of him the fact that he has stayed with his ex - xxunk while in xxmaj san xxmaj francisco , and had sex with her . xxmaj the latter revelation turns out to be a lie . xxmaj the two of them make out in the xxunk , but she decides that they must break up . xxmaj nick is xxunk . \\n\\n xxmaj and we follow xxmaj nick , who confesses his xxunk to an older woman who he meets on a park bench , xxmaj joey ( carol xxmaj kane ) . xxmaj joey is sort of weird and child - like , but is a good audience for xxmaj nick , who needs a sympathetic ear . xxmaj the two of them go to xxmaj xxunk xxmaj island at night , and look at the stars . xxmaj nick falls under xxmaj joey 's spell , despite the age difference between them . xxmaj they go back to xxmaj joey 's apartment , and xxmaj nick gradually realizes that he is about to have sex with a crazy old woman . xxmaj she is on top of him , does n't want to let him go . xxmaj but he manages to escape . \\n\\n ( this is , by the way , the best xxmaj carol xxmaj kane role since she played xxmaj xxunk 's wife in xxmaj taxi . ) xxmaj joey 's phone rings , and it is a man calling the xxmaj psychic xxmaj friends xxmaj network , and xxmaj joey is one of the psychic friends . xxmaj although she is still hurting from xxmaj nick , she gradually gets into her psychic xxunk . xxmaj the man is at his office , late at night , and wants to have phone sex with her . xxmaj although that is not xxmaj joey 's business , xxmaj joey goes along , and coaxes the man to come . xxmaj she wants to keep talking , although the man want to get off the phone , and finds out that he has xxunk a lot of money from his company , and will be found out xxunk . xxmaj his life is ruined . xxmaj joey realizes that the man is going to commit suicide , and she tries to make him believe that she is his friend , that she cares about him . xxmaj and she does care about him . \\n\\n xxmaj but the man packs a gun into his xxunk , and goes off to seek a prostitute on the xxmaj brooklyn xxunk , and we come back to the beginning , to the same prostitute who started out xxmaj la xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj she wants to give him $ xxunk , xxrep 3 0 in cash if she will kill him . xxmaj he tried to kill himself , but could n't do it . xxmaj the prostitute does not want to do it , but he insists , holding her hand , holding the gun inside his mouth , telling her where to aim . xxmaj eventually , the gun goes off , and we see the prostitute walking down the street , and xxunk at the corner where she normally does business . xxmaj the contractor who did n't pay her earlier in the movie drives up , xxunk down the window . xxmaj they look at each other . xxup the xxup end .</td>\n",

       "      <td>xxbos i really wanted to love this show . i truly , honestly did . \\n\\n xxmaj for the first time , gay viewers get their own version of the \" the xxmaj bachelor \" . xxmaj with the help of his obligatory \" hag \" xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj james , a good looking , well - to - do thirty - something has the chance of love with 15 suitors ( or \" mates \" as they are referred to in the show ) . xxmaj the only problem is half of them are straight and xxmaj james does n't know this . xxmaj if xxmaj james picks a gay one , they get a trip to xxmaj new xxmaj zealand , and xxmaj if he picks a straight one , straight guy gets $ 25 , xxrep 3 0 . xxmaj how can this not be fun ? ! xxmaj take my hand , lets xxunk : \\n\\n xxmaj the most glaring problem with this show is the bachelor himself . xxmaj james is your typical young and successful gay guy with a nice smile and body , the one you 'd probably give two glances towards at your local bar before xxunk for xxunk xxunk . xxmaj why they chose to cast xxmaj james as the leading man is beyond me . xxmaj god knows there 's so many other hotter and xxunk homosexual men out there dying to be on xxup tv . \\n\\n xxmaj aside from his rather average physical appearance , xxmaj james is about as interesting and exciting as a piece of chalk . xxmaj even as such , he has this arrogant , xxunk xxunk xxunk about him . xxmaj however , if xxmaj james were standing up against a blank , white wall he 'd xxunk right into in it . i honestly ca n't recall a single interesting or xxunk thing xxmaj james said during the course of the show . xxmaj he is xxup that boring and forgettable . xxmaj in fact , one of the mates flat out xxunk him he was n't feeling a connection . i thought that was the best part of the show . xxmaj also , xxmaj james speaks with an excruciatingly annoying xxunk . xxmaj sound feminine or sound xxunk , but do n't xxrep 4 * xxunk xxunk xxunk in the middle of sentences … so painful to sit through . i hated him so much all throughout the show i kept thinking , \" please choose a straight guy and xxunk yourself and your unfortunate looking hag \" \\n\\n xxmaj then we have the suitors . a remarkably bland bunch of men who do n't seem to care either way what is happening . xxmaj equally xxunk , they seem to be xxunk from one guy to the next except , \" hey that guy has blond highlights or oh that one has curly hair \" xxmaj again , xxunk inept casting decisions seem to be the aim of this show . xxmaj while it may be hackneyed to type cast roles , it would 've been a lot more entertaining to watch than these xxunk drones . xxmaj however , in all their xxunk they still manage to upstage xxmaj james ( which is n't all that hard to do anyway ) , slightly that is . xxmaj you know you have a problem when some of the suitors are actually hotter and more interesting than the leading man . xxmaj and the fact that the suitors seem to have more fun around xxup each xxup other than with the leading man ? xxmaj very sad . \\n\\n xxmaj also , i just thought that xxmaj i d point something mentioned on the message xxunk which i felt was actually true : the straight men are all hotter than the gay guys . \\n\\n xxmaj do n't get me wrong , xxmaj i m not saying all the gay guys were ugly and boring , as a matter of fact i found some of them very cute . xxmaj it 's just that overall they were just xxup blah compared to the men you 'd see on shows like a xxmaj shot xxmaj at xxmaj love with xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk or xxmaj the xxmaj xxunk . \\n\\n i do n't know how many times i hit fast forward during this show . i can accept a lead character as interesting as a cardboard box , i can accept the xxunk , xxunk suitors but xxup please for the love of xxmaj god entertain me just a little . xxmaj no such luck . \\n\\n xxmaj if you 're expecting drama , intrigue , xxunk , or excitement you will be xxup severely disappointed . xxmaj the biggest \" drama \" comes from the fact that one of the suitors still may have a boyfriend in xxmaj new xxmaj york ( how xxunk ! ) . xxmaj as xxunk as that may be i guarantee you , that is the xxup only thing that remotely resembles any conflict on this show . \\n\\n xxmaj sure there is the twist , but if you have any semblance of xxmaj xxunk in you , you 'll easily xxunk who 's who ( it was n't hard at all , i was only wrong once . ) xxmaj this show is stacking so much of its xxunk on the twist that it fails to deliver anywhere else . \\n\\n xxmaj we get to watch as xxmaj james &amp; xxmaj co xxunk along such exciting activities such as learning how to xxmaj western step dance , shopping for xxunk , visiting a xxunk xxunk , and gay xxunk . xxup yawn . xxmaj sure you have the occasional topless dancing but who cares when everyone is boring anyway . xxmaj that 's one of main problems with the show : xxup no xxup one seems to be enjoying themselves -- they are there just going through the motion trying xxunk hard to appear to have a good time . xxmaj and you really ca nt blame them since the events are all wildly unimaginative and lame . \\n\\n xxmaj finally , the physical aspect is not there . xxmaj there 's no xxunk , no xxunk , no kissing ( ! ) , no xxunk of any sort . xxmaj it 's just \" ok that was a boring date , xxmaj i m gon na go back to my ugly , tacky wanna - be xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk dwelling ( quick xxunk on the lips ) xxup xxunk . \" xxmaj this show is so xxrep 4 * xxunk xxunk it 's ridiculous . i can understand them not wanting to play up the xxunk xxunk nature of homosexual men , but come the xxrep 4 * on . xxmaj people who watch reality xxup tv shows are gon na want more than xxunk xxunk and xxunk kisses . xxmaj this show refuses to compromise . \\n\\n xxmaj sorry if this was long winded but i felt these were issues that needed to be xxunk . i do commend xxmaj bravo for first putting up a show of this nature , but the xxunk incompetent manner in which this show was handled is mind xxunk . xxmaj to summarize my three points : xxmaj boring + xxmaj boring + xxmaj boring = go do something else . xxmaj you 'll have more fun waiting at a doctor 's office for an xxunk , at least they have interesting xxunk there .</td>\n",
