       "      <td>xxbos xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas : a xxmaj review \\n\\n xxmaj you know , xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is like sticking your hands into a big , xxunk bowl of xxunk . xxmaj it 's warm and gooey , but you 're not sure if it feels right . xxmaj try as i might , no matter how warm and gooey xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas became i was always aware that something did n't quite feel right . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas suffers from a certain xxunk on the director 's part . xxmaj apparently , the director thought that the ethnic backdrop of a xxmaj latino family on the lower east side , and an xxunk storyline would make the film critic proof . xxmaj he was right , but it did n't fool me . xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is the story about a xxunk - year old boy called , you guessed it , xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas ( victor xxmaj xxunk ) who lives his teenage years chasing more xxunk than the xxmaj rolling xxmaj xxunk could do in all the years they 've xxunk . xxmaj the movie starts off in ` ugly xxmaj fat ' xxmaj donna 's bedroom where xxmaj victor is sure to seduce her , but a cry from outside xxunk his plans when his best - friend xxmaj harold ( kevin xxmaj xxunk ) comes - a - looking for him . xxmaj caught in the attempt by xxmaj harold and his sister , xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas runs off for xxunk control . xxmaj yet even with the embarrassing implication that he 's been xxunk the xxunk girl in the neighborhood , nothing xxunk young xxmaj victor from going off on the hunt for more fresh meat . xxmaj on a hot , xxmaj new xxmaj york xxmaj city day they make way to the local public swimming pool where xxmaj victor 's eyes catch a glimpse of the lovely young xxunk xxmaj judy ( judy xxmaj xxunk ) , who 's not just pretty , but a strong and independent too . xxmaj the relationship that develops between xxmaj victor and xxmaj judy becomes the focus of the film . xxmaj the story also focuses on xxmaj victor 's family that is comprised of his grandmother or xxunk ( xxunk xxmaj guzman ) , his brother xxmaj nino ( also played by real life brother to xxmaj victor , xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) and his sister xxmaj vicky ( xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) . xxmaj the action follows xxmaj victor between scenes with xxmaj judy and scenes with his family . xxmaj victor tries to xxunk with being an oversexed pimp - daddy , his feelings for xxmaj judy and his grandmother 's conservative xxmaj catholic upbringing . \\n\\n xxmaj the problems that xxunk from xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas are a few , but glaring errors . xxmaj throughout the film you get to know certain characters like xxmaj vicky , xxmaj nino , xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj judy and even xxmaj judy 's best friend xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj the problem is , we know nothing of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas except that he is the biggest gigolo in the neighborhood . xxmaj we know that he knows how to lick his lips , and xxunk his xxunk , and carry himself for the sake of xxunk girls into the xxunk , but that 's all . xxmaj we know that xxmaj nino plays piano , and quiet well , you could see it by the awards on the family piano . xxmaj we know his sister xxmaj xxunk , is a gossip - loving girl with an xxunk interest in watching xxup tv . xxmaj we know that xxunk is a hard - working traditional xxmaj xxunk woman who 's trying to raise her kids with xxunk in a world of excess corruption . xxmaj yet where is the titular character , xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas ? xxmaj he 's in this movie somewhere , but we only know what the movie tells us . xxmaj this is by far the film 's biggest flaw . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is n't so much a character but a xxunk - xxunk ball , xxunk between scenes with xxmaj judy and his xxmaj grandmother , but we never get to know who xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas really is . xxmaj this is important because as xxmaj i 've mentioned the only thing we know of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is that he 's a sexually active teenager with a xxunk the size of xxmaj manhattan . xxmaj he 's a total xxmaj xxunk - male . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is not the kind of character i sympathize with at all . xxmaj why should anyone ? xxmaj so by the end of the movie , in the aftermath of the climax are we truly led to believe that somehow xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas has attained xxup any depth and learned the errors of his ways ? xxmaj how could such a two - dimensional character have any depth ? xxmaj if only the director had worried a little more about xxunk out his main character instead of worrying about getting that perfect hand - held shot . \\n\\n xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas brings to life the world of the xxmaj latino inner - city neighborhood to the big screen . xxmaj something that few films have done before in the past . xxmaj the film has been xxunk for feeling so real , and i wo n't \\n\\n argue with that . i have n't seen this level of reality since xxup xxunk aired xxmaj survivor . xxmaj seriously , although the movie has some nice shots of the city , the writer / director xxmaj peter xxmaj sollett was way too xxunk on close - ups and hand - held shots . xxmaj this problem is particularly noticed in xxunk scenes that are so claustrophobic i was forced to perform deep - breathing xxunk to keep from passing out . xxmaj as the film continues , the shots get tighter and tighter with faces xxunk from xxunk to xxunk on the screen ; you can practically xxunk xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas 's cheap xxunk . xxmaj the overall effect is unrealistic in contrast . xxmaj the xxunk scenes of inner - city apartments make them look small and xxunk , which is not true . xxmaj i 've been in those type apartments ; i used to live in one . xxmaj they 're not xxunk but they have high xxunk and they 're decent living xxunk . xxmaj by the movie 's standards you 'd think that these apartments were xxunk xxunk of xxunk - and - xxunk , xxunk paint and xxunk walls . xxmaj unfortunately , xxmaj sollett 's constant use of close - ups and one particularly bad shot with a xxunk - in on one scene come off as totally amateurish . xxmaj but xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is only xxmaj sollett 's second film , and his most well known , a solid effort in filmmaking that will hopefully get better as he continues to make films . xxmaj one review i read xxunk the movie as , ` ethnicity for xxmaj ethnicity 's xxmaj sake , ' and i can not agree more . xxmaj if xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas were truly a great film and story , then the characters ' xxunk would n't matter whether they were xxmaj latino , xxmaj chinese , etc . xxmaj yet if you were to take this story and stick it in middle - class xxunk with a bunch of xxunk - xxunk white kids the results would n't be such glowing reviews , and we 'd see the film 's flaws more clearly . xxmaj indeed , some other aspects of the use of xxmaj latinos in this film bother me . xxmaj while some aspects of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas are accurate others i have to question . xxmaj for example , xxmaj victor , xxmaj nino and xxmaj vicky all share the same room to sleep . xxmaj this set off an alarm for me because it seemed contrary to what i believe . xxmaj any self - xxunk xxmaj latino family would n't have two older brothers sharing the same room with a thirteen - year old girl . xxmaj at first i was xxunk , perhaps i was wrong , but after speaking with my grandmother i knew my problem with this was justified . xxmaj considering how conservative the grandmother is , you 'd think that xxmaj vicky would have been sleeping in her room . \\n\\n xxmaj as a xxmaj latino who grew up in a somewhat conservative xxmaj cuban household , raised by my grandmother while my mother was working full - time , i could relate to the movie in many ways , which is why my critical xxunk are xxunk because i really wanted to love this movie . xxmaj unfortunately , my lack of respect for xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas xxunk my feelings for the film . xxmaj maybe it 's because xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas reminds me of those guys who were getting laid while i was playing with my xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk when i was xxunk . xxmaj maybe it 's because without any further xxunk by the film , xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is merely a stereotypical hot - blooded xxmaj latino , who 'll just end up shouting to girls from his car , ` hey bay - xxunk , xxunk want to get into my xxunk xxunk - xxunk ? ' xxmaj either way i do n't like him , so ultimately how can i like a film about him ? xxmaj so if you 'll excuse me , xxmaj i 'm going to go stick my hands into a bowl of xxunk .</td>\n",

       "      <td>xxbos xxmaj now that xxmaj che(2008 ) has finished its relatively short xxmaj australian cinema run ( extremely limited xxunk screen in xxmaj xxunk , after xxunk ) , i can xxunk join both xxunk of \" at xxmaj the xxmaj movies \" in taking xxmaj steven xxmaj soderbergh to task . \\n\\n xxmaj it 's usually satisfying to watch a film director change his style / subject , but xxmaj soderbergh 's most recent stinker , xxmaj the xxmaj girlfriend xxmaj xxunk ) , was also missing a story , so narrative ( and editing ? ) seem to suddenly be xxmaj soderbergh 's main challenge . xxmaj strange , after xxunk years in the business . xxmaj he was probably never much good at narrative , just xxunk it well inside \" edgy \" projects . \\n\\n xxmaj none of this excuses him this present , almost diabolical failure . xxmaj as xxmaj david xxmaj stratton xxunk , \" two parts of xxmaj che do n't ( even ) make a whole \" . \\n\\n xxmaj epic xxunk in name only , xxmaj che(2008 ) barely qualifies as a feature film ! xxmaj it certainly has no legs , xxunk as except for its xxunk ultimate resolution forced upon it by history , xxmaj soderbergh 's xxunk - long xxunk just goes nowhere . \\n\\n xxmaj even xxmaj margaret xxmaj xxunk , the more xxunk of xxmaj australia 's xxmaj at xxmaj the xxmaj movies duo , noted about xxmaj soderbergh 's xxunk waste of ( xxunk digital xxunk ) : \" you 're in the woods … you 're in the woods … you 're in the woods … \" . i too am surprised xxmaj soderbergh did n't give us another xxunk of xxup that somewhere between his xxunk two xxmaj parts , because he still left out massive xxunk of xxmaj che 's \" xxunk \" life ! \\n\\n xxmaj for a xxunk of an important but infamous historical figure , xxmaj soderbergh xxunk xxunk , if not deliberately insults , his audiences by \\n\\n 1 . never providing most of xxmaj che 's story ; \\n\\n 2 . xxunk xxunk film xxunk with mere xxunk xxunk ; \\n\\n 3 . xxunk both true hindsight and a narrative of events ; \\n\\n 4 . barely developing an idea , or a character ; \\n\\n 5 . remaining xxunk episodic ; \\n\\n 6 . xxunk proper context for scenes xxrep 3 - whatever we do get is xxunk in xxunk xxunk ; \\n\\n 7 . xxunk xxunk all audiences ( even xxmaj spanish - xxunk will be confused by the xxunk xxunk in xxmaj english ) ; and \\n\\n 8 . xxunk xxunk his main subject into one dimension . xxmaj why , at xxup this late stage ? xxmaj the xxmaj t - shirt franchise has been a success ! \\n\\n xxmaj our sense of xxunk is surely due to xxmaj peter xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj benjamin xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxunk their screenplay solely on xxmaj xxunk 's memoirs . xxmaj so , like a poor student who has read only xxup one of his xxunk xxunk for his xxunk , xxmaj soderbergh 's product is xxunk limited in perspective . \\n\\n xxmaj the audience is held captive within the same xxunk knowledge , scenery and circumstances of the \" revolutionaries \" , but that does n't xxunk our sympathy . xxmaj instead , it xxunk on us that \" ah , xxmaj soderbergh 's trying to xxunk his audiences the same as the xxmaj latino peasants were at the time \" . xxmaj but these are the xxup same illiterate xxmaj latino peasants who sold out the good doctor to his enemies . xxmaj why does xxmaj soderbergh feel the need to xxunk us with them , and keep us equally mentally captive ? xxmaj such audience xxunk must have a purpose . \\n\\n xxmaj part2 is more xxunk than xxmaj part1 , but it 's literally mind - numbing with its repetitive bush - bashing , misery of outlook , and lack of variety or character xxunk . deltoro 's xxmaj che has no opportunity to grow as a person while he struggles to xxunk his own ill - xxunk troops . xxmaj the only xxunk is the humour as xxmaj che deals with his sometimes deeply ignorant \" revolutionaries \" , some of whom xxunk lack self - control around local peasants or food . xxmaj we certainly get no insight into what caused the conditions , nor any xxunk xxunk of their xxunk xxunk , such as it was . \\n\\n xxmaj part2 's excruciating xxunk remains xxunk episodic : again , nothing is telegraphed or xxunk . xxmaj thus even the scenes with xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) are unexpected and disconcerting . xxmaj any xxunk events are portrayed xxunk and xxmaj latino - xxunk , with xxmaj part1 's interviews replaced by time - xxunk xxunk between the corrupt xxmaj xxunk president ( xxunk de xxmaj xxunk ) and xxup us xxmaj government xxunk promising xxup cia xxunk ( ! ) . \\n\\n xxmaj the rest of xxmaj part2 's \" woods \" and day - for - night blue xxunk just xxunk the audience until they 're xxunk the xxunk . \\n\\n xxmaj perhaps deltoro felt too xxunk the frustration of many non - american xxmaj latinos about never getting a truthful , xxunk history of xxmaj che 's exploits within their own countries . xxmaj when foreign xxunk still wo n't deliver a free press to their people -- for whatever reason -- then one can see how a popular xxmaj american indie producer might set out to entice the not - so - well - read ( \" i may not be able to read or write , but xxmaj i 'm xxup not xxunk xxmaj inspector xxmaj xxunk ) ) out to their own local cinemas . xxmaj the film 's obvious xxunk and gross over - xxunk hint very strongly that it 's aiming only at the xxunk of the less - informed xxup who xxup still xxup speak xxup little xxmaj english . xxmaj if they did , they 'd have read xxunk on the subject already , and xxunk the relevant social issues amongst themselves -- learning the lessons of history as they should . \\n\\n xxmaj such insights are precisely what societies still need -- and not just the remaining illiterate xxmaj latinos of xxmaj central and xxmaj south xxmaj america -- yet it 's what xxmaj che(2008 ) xxunk fails to deliver . xxmaj soderbergh xxunk his lead because he 's weak on narrative . i am xxunk why xxmaj xxunk deltoro deliberately chose xxmaj soderbergh for this project if he knew this . xxmaj it 's been xxunk , hindsight about xxmaj xxunk was xxunk wanted : it 's what i went to see this film for , but the director xxunk robs us of that . \\n\\n xxmaj david xxmaj stratton , writing in xxmaj the xxmaj australian ( xxunk ) observed that while xxmaj part1 was \" uneven \" , xxmaj part2 actually \" goes rapidly downhill \" from there , \" xxunk xxmaj che 's final campaign in xxmaj xxunk in excruciating detail \" , which \" … feels almost unbearably slow and turgid \" . \\n\\n che : the xxmaj xxunk aka xxmaj part2 is certainly no xxunk for xxmaj xxunk , painting it a picture of misery and xxunk . xxmaj the entire second half is only redeemed by the aforementioned humour , and the dramatic -- yet tragic -- capture and execution of the film 's subject . \\n\\n xxmaj the rest of this xxunk cinema xxunk is just confusing , irritating misery -- xxunk , for a xxmaj soderbergh film , to be avoided at all costs . xxmaj it is bound to break the hearts of all who know even just a xxunk about the xxunk / 10 )</td>\n",
